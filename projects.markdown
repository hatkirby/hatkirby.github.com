# Projects
These are some of the projects that I'm currently working on.

* [rawr-ebooks](http://github.com/hatkirby/rawr-ebooks) - Generates nonsense statistically similar to an input document, and optionally posts it to twitter. Canonically is run under the Twitter account [@Rawr_Ebooks](https://twitter.com/Rawr_Ebooks) with an ever-growing input (which is currently around 200000 words long).
* [fiqdb](http://github.com/hatkirby/fiqdb) - A simple quotes database written in Ruby on Rails. Quotes can have various amounts of metadata, including rating, tags, notes, an audio version, and more. Project name stands for "**F**our **I**sland **Q**uotes **D**ata**b**ase", as the project was forked from [the quotes database](http://quotes.fourisland.com/) I wrote for my old website, Four Island.
